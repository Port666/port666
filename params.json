  "body": "= Hi\r\n\r\nWelcom to Port666. Here you can find my ideas about next journalism put in practice. For the moment, I'm trying to understand how to publish/write here at this big home at Github. Sorry my english, my money all these years has been for the Internet, not for English teachers. So, Internet teached my and teaches every day how to read (I do it well) and write (no so well) english.\r\n\r\nMy name is Merc√® Molist. I work as a journalist since I was 18. Now I'm 47 years old. So it 30 years that I work as a journalist. I came into Internet at 1995 and, since then, I love Internet and all my investigations and works are to and for Internet, its people and, specially, hacker people. I've written some books, the most loved for me is \"Hackstory.es\", it tells the history of spanish hackers in their first years, decades 80 and 90. You can find it at http://hackstory.es\r\n\r\nit's easy :)\r\n\r\nwell, I continue my findings, readings and trying to understand how does this Github site for coders with english skills can work for a no-programmer (I'm a coder of language) no-english madam. \r\n\r\n",
